v0.2.3
- Initially published version

v0.2.4
- Fixed closing of file descriptor of event loop's semaphore on exec
- Fixed interrupt handling when polling
- Improved tutorial
- Fixed issue with googlemock
- Added object proxy factory overload that takes unique_ptr to a connection
- Workaround: Clang compilation error when compiling sdbus::Struct (seems like an issue of Clang)

v0.2.5
- Real fix for issue with sdbus::Struct inherited constructors
- Little code refactorings and improvements

v0.2.6
- Fixed memory leak in Message copy operations

v0.3.0
- Introduced support for asynchronous server-side methods
- Refactored the concept of Message into distinctive concrete message types
- As this release comes with breaking API changes:
    * if you're using lower-level API, please rename 'Message' to whatever concrete message type (MethodCall, MethodReply, Signal) is needed there,
    * if you're using higher-level API, please re-compile and re-link your application against sdbus-c++,
    * if you're using generated stub headers, please re-compile and re-link your application against sdbus-c++.

v0.3.1
- Fixed hogging the CPU by server with async methods (issue #15)

v0.3.2
- Switched from autotools to CMake build system

v0.3.3
- Minor fixes in tutorial examples
- Add comment on threading traits of Variant and its const methods
- Fix broken invariant of const Variant::peekValueType() method

v0.4.0
- Introduce support and implementation of common D-Bus annotations
- Remove hard-coded warning-related compiler options from the build system

v0.4.1
- Change constexpr member into a getter method to be compatible across odr-usage rules of various compiler versions

v0.4.2
- Improve documentation
- Minor code improvements
- Introduce sdbus-c++ performance tests with measurements

v0.4.3
- Add another abstraction layer for sd-bus to improve isolation for unit testing
- Minor code improvements for consistency and clarity
- Not-existing interface name and object path fixes in integration tests

v0.5.0
- Redesign of the Connection model for scalability, thread-safety, simplicity and clarity
- [[Breaking ABI change]] Introduce support asynchronous invocation of D-Bus methods on client-side
- Revise and extend sdbus-c++ tutorial
- Introduce stress tests that involve a D-Bus server and client interacting in dense communication in both sync and async ways
- Compilation error fixes for older gcc versions

v0.5.1
- Cleanups of CMakeLists.txt
- Rename sdbus-c++ test executables for consistency
- Rename sdbus-c++ stub code generator executable
- Introduce generation of doxygen documentation
- Improve documentation

v0.5.2
- Simplify and unify basic API level callbacks for both sync and async methods

v0.5.3
- Extend stress tests with dynamic object and proxy creation and destruction from multiple threads
- [[Breaking ABI change]] Add getConnection() method to IObject
- A few minor fixes

v0.6.0
- This release comes with a number of API and ABI breaking changes (that hopefully lead to a more mature and stable API for near future):
  - Some constructs have been renamed (see below for details), you'll have to adapt your sources whether you're using the basic or the convenience sdbus-c++ API.
  - You'll also have to re-generate adaptor/proxy stubs with the new stub code generator if you're using them.
  - And you'll have to take care of manual registeration/deregistration in the constructors/destructors of your final adaptor and proxy classes. See updated using sdbus-c++ tutorial.
- Cleaning up some names (of class, methods, files):
  * ConvenienceClasses.h/.inl/.cpp -> ConvenienceApiClasses.h/.inl/.cpp
  * IObjectProxy class -> IProxy
  * Interfaces class -> AdaptorInterfaces
  * Interfaces.h -> split into AdaptorInterfaces.h and ProxyInterfaces.h
  * createObjectProxy() method -> createProxy()
- Add new unregister() virtual function to IObject and IProxy to allow for safe construction and destructions of D-Bus ojects and proxies hooked to live D-Bus connections.
- Extend stress tests to allow testing safe initialization/deinitialization of objects and proxies
- Fix gcc warnings
- Use release v1.8.1 of googletest for tests
