    * if you're using higher-level API, please re-compile and re-link your application against sdbus-c++,
    * if you're using generated stub headers, please re-compile and re-link your application against sdbus-c++.

v0.5.3
- Extend stress tests with dynamic object and proxy creation and destruction from multiple threads
- [[Breaking ABI change]] Add getConnection() method to IObject
- A few minor fixes

v0.6.0
- This release comes with a number of API and ABI breaking changes (that hopefully lead to a more mature and stable API for near future):
  - Some constructs have been renamed (see below for details), you'll have to adapt your sources whether you're using the basic or the convenience sdbus-c++ API.
  - You'll also have to re-generate adaptor/proxy stubs with the new stub code generator if you're using them.
  - And you'll have to take care of manual registeration/deregistration in the constructors/destructors of your final adaptor and proxy classes. See updated using sdbus-c++ tutorial.
- Cleaning up some names (of class, methods, files):
  * ConvenienceClasses.h/.inl/.cpp -> ConvenienceApiClasses.h/.inl/.cpp
  * IObjectProxy class -> IProxy
  * Interfaces class -> AdaptorInterfaces
  * Interfaces.h -> split into AdaptorInterfaces.h and ProxyInterfaces.h
  * createObjectProxy() method -> createProxy()
- Add new unregister() virtual function to IObject and IProxy to allow for safe construction and destructions of D-Bus ojects and proxies hooked to live D-Bus connections.
- Extend stress tests to allow testing safe initialization/deinitialization of objects and proxies
- Fix gcc warnings
- Use release v1.8.1 of googletest for tests

v0.7.0
- [[Breaking ABI change]] Added full support for ObjectManager, Properties and other standard D-Bus interfaces (Reordering virtual functions in interface classes)
- sdbus-c++ now can automatically download, build and incorporate libsystemd static library, which makes things pretty easy in non-systemd environments
- Minor changes in generated proxy/adaptor code:
  * renamed interfaceName to INTERFACE_NAME to avoid potential naming clashes
  * signal emitting methods now begin with "emit" prefix and capitalized first letter of signal name
- sdbus-c++ file organization has been adjusted to comply to de-facto OSS project standards
- Build system improvements -- moving towards more modern CMake
- Using googletest from master branch instead of v1.8.1 which has THREADS_PTHREAD_ARG issue when cross-compiling
- Documentation improvements
- Minor changes (renamings) in the code generated by sdbus-c++-xml2cpp generator
- Other minor fixes and internal design improvements

- Fix race condition of polling on D-Bus fd from two threads (event loop thread and sync D-Bus call thread)
- Little ordering fix in stress tests

v0.7.8
- Switch from thread_local to global bus instance that is used to create Variant instances (thread_local caused issues with Variant in very special inter-thread situations)

v0.8.0
