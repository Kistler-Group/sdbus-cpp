v0.6.0
- This release comes with a number of API and ABI breaking changes (that hopefully lead to a more mature and stable API for near future):
  - Some constructs have been renamed (see below for details), you'll have to adapt your sources whether you're using the basic or the convenience sdbus-c++ API.
  - You'll also have to re-generate adaptor/proxy stubs with the new stub code generator if you're using them.
  - And you'll have to take care of manual registeration/deregistration in the constructors/destructors of your final adaptor and proxy classes. See updated using sdbus-c++ tutorial.
- Cleaning up some names (of class, methods, files):
  * ConvenienceClasses.h/.inl/.cpp -> ConvenienceApiClasses.h/.inl/.cpp
  * IObjectProxy class -> IProxy
  * Interfaces class -> AdaptorInterfaces
  * Interfaces.h -> split into AdaptorInterfaces.h and ProxyInterfaces.h
  * createObjectProxy() method -> createProxy()
